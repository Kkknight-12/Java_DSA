# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The goal of this repository is to
help others learn and understand these fundamental computer science concepts.

## Contents

The repository is organized into two main sections: Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Data Structures

Here you'll find implementations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

### Algorithms

This section includes various algorithms, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
- Dynamic programming problems
- Greedy algorithms

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm has its own directory. Inside each directory, you'll find a file containing the
implementation, along with a README file that explains the concept and usage of the data structure or algorithm.
