In Java, there are two types of data types: primitive data types and object data types.

Primitive data types are the basic data types that are built-in to the Java language. They include:

- **`int`**: for whole numbers
- **`float`**: for decimal numbers
- **`double`**: for decimal numbers with a larger range
- **`boolean`**: for true or false values
- **`char`**: for a single character
- **`byte`**: for 8-bit integers
- **`short`**: for 16-bit integers
- **`long`**: for 64-bit integers

Primitive data types are stored directly in the memory and are not objects, they are also called value types. They are
fast and efficient to use but they do not have methods to perform operations on them.

On the other hand, object data types are reference types. They are created by the programmer and are instances of a
class. Object data types are stored as references to objects in memory, and are also known as reference types. They are
slower and less efficient than primitive data types but have methods to perform operations on them.

In summary, the main difference between primitive and object data types is that primitive data types are built-in to the
language, are stored directly in memory, and do not have methods, while object data types are created by the programmer,
are stored as references to objects in memory and have methods.
